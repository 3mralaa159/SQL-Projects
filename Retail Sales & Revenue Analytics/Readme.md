This project presents a structured SQL-based analysis framework designed for a large-scale retail business with multiple stores, clients, vendors, items, staff, stocks, transactions, and brands. The objective is to extract actionable insights from transactional data using advanced SQL queries.

## **A: Sales Volume & Revenue Metrics**
- is to explore and monitor business performance across various dimensions. By using well-modeled relational tables and powerful SQL techniques, the analysis answers critical business questions such as:
   - Which stores and products generate the most revenue?
   - What are the daily, monthly, and client-segment revenue trends?
  - How do average transaction values and sales volumes evolve over time?

- The project demonstrates practical use of:

   - Joins across transactional and master data
   - Aggregate functions and subqueries
    - Window functions for rankings and growth tracking
    - Date-based grouping for trend analysis

- This work lays the foundation for a broader Retail Business Intelligence system, useful for data analysts, retail managers, and stakeholders who aim to:
  - Increase profitability
  - Improve inventory planning
  - Make data-driven decisions

## **B: Customer Behavior & Engagement Analysis**
- This section focuses on analyzing how customers interact with the retail business. By tracking engagement levels, identifying churn patterns, and understanding behavior (such as visit frequency and time of purchase), we can create personalized campaigns, reduce churn, and improve the overall customer experience.

- Key Themes:
   - Customer loyalty and retention
   - Visit frequency and purchase timing
   - Churn detection and win-back opportunities
   - Buying behavior segmentation
   - Personalization and lifecycle analysis
