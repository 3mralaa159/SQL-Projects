This project presents a structured SQL-based analysis framework designed for a large-scale retail business with multiple stores, clients, vendors, items, staff, stocks, transactions, and brands. The objective is to extract actionable insights from transactional data using advanced SQL queries.

The focus of this module—Section A: Sales Volume & Revenue Metrics—is to explore and monitor business performance across various dimensions. By using well-modeled relational tables and powerful SQL techniques, the analysis answers critical business questions such as:

Which stores and products generate the most revenue?

What are the daily, monthly, and client-segment revenue trends?

How do average transaction values and sales volumes evolve over time?

The project demonstrates practical use of:

Joins across transactional and master data

Aggregate functions and subqueries

Window functions for rankings and growth tracking

Date-based grouping for trend analysis

This work lays the foundation for a broader Retail Business Intelligence system, useful for data analysts, retail managers, and stakeholders who aim to:

Increase profitability

Improve inventory planning

Make data-driven decisions
